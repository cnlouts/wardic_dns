wardic_dns - war(from war dialing/driving) dictionary attack on dns
wardic_dns is ruby  subnet dns dictionary brute force attack, is only as good as the dictionary file you use with it

I recommend to use the "rockyou.txt" diccionary, but here included there is a small example dicctionary for you with common subnet names.

this is just a simple proof of concept in ruby.. feel free to fork and commit your changes back.
